      Abstract:
    </p>
    <p>
      Underwater robots, also known as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) or remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs), are advanced technological machines designed to explore and operate in the depths of the ocean. These sophisticated machines are equipped with a variety of sensors, cameras, and manipulators, allowing them to navigate through the underwater environment, collect data, and perform a wide range of tasks. From scientific research and environmental monitoring to offshore infrastructure inspection and military applications, underwater robots play a vital role in exploring and understanding the mysterious world beneath the ocean's surface. As technology continues to advance, the capabilities of underwater robots are expanding, opening up new possibilities for exploration and discovery in one of the Earth's least explored frontiers.<br>

At Polytechnic university of Madrid, we are focused on bioinspired underwater robots are a fascinating fusion of nature and technology, drawing inspiration from the incredible adaptability and efficiency of earth and marine creatures. Mimicking the form and function of some animals like monkeys, dogs, mantarey, fish, octopuses, and jellyfish, these robots are designed to navigate complex underwater environments with remarkable agility and grace. By incorporating biomimetic features such as flexible bodies, undulating fins, and sensory systems inspired by marine organisms, bioinspired underwater robots offer a unique approach to exploring and interacting with the ocean's depths. With applications ranging from underwater surveillance and environmental monitoring to search and rescue operations, these robots showcase the ingenuity of human engineering inspired by the wonders of the natural world. As researchers continue to unlock the secrets of marine life, bioinspired underwater robots promise to revolutionize our understanding of underwater exploration and inspire future innovations in robotics and marine science.
